# Healthy Software Developer
---
The syntax and patterns you use on software projects don't matter nearly as much as the standards you hold yourself to for professionalism.

## Why senior code matters
- **Team comprehension**

You need other programmers to be able to read your code if they are going to consider you senior. You've probably heard how programmers are often better at writing code than reading it. And if you want other members of your team to treat you like a professional, you have to reject myths like "self documenting code" and treat your code like a personal brand.

- **Reduce interruptions**

Writing high quality code will reduce the time you spend supporting it and explaining it to other members of the software development team. Many programmers are frustrated that they have to explain their code to other members of the team. If your code really is self documenting - shouldn't that not be the case?

- **Extend longevity of code**

Writing code like truly senior programmers do will reduce the chance somebody comes along to rewrite it just because they like some other coding pattern more. To increase the shelf life of your code, having the habits and discipline to follow the 6 tips for writing code like a senior programmer will make a huge impact on how others see you and your quality of life on software projects.

## 6 habits of senior programmers
1. [Prevent unfinished work](https://github.com/mmelamud-godaddy/how-to-become-a-better-developer/blob/main/healthy-software-developer.md#prevent-unfinished-work)
2. [Enforce coding standards](https://github.com/mmelamud-godaddy/how-to-become-a-better-developer/blob/main/healthy-software-developer.md#enforce-coding-standards)
3. [Document chosen patterns](https://github.com/mmelamud-godaddy/how-to-become-a-better-developer/blob/main/healthy-software-developer.md#document-chosen-patterns)
4. [Review new patterns early](https://github.com/mmelamud-godaddy/how-to-become-a-better-developer/blob/main/healthy-software-developer.md#review-new-patterns-early)
5. [Never expose refactoring](https://github.com/mmelamud-godaddy/how-to-become-a-better-developer/blob/main/healthy-software-developer.md#never-expose-refactoring)
6. [Assume unexpected change](https://github.com/mmelamud-godaddy/how-to-become-a-better-developer/blob/main/healthy-software-developer.md#assume-unexpected-change)

## Prevent unfinished work
Finish the code you start! There's immense pressure on some scrum or kanban projects to show progress, but if you aren't done - don't lie about it! This only leads to more personal technical debt that you will be under more stress to finish later. If you don't want to let the code grow out of control - this is completely up to you.
## Enforce coding standards
Enforce coding standards. If other programmers on your team have different preferences for how they like to format curly braces, spacing, or any other aspect of your code - this makes it frustrating to share code across the project. We've got the tools to do this automatically now - use them!
## Document chosen patterns
Be disciplined about documenting the patterns the team has agreed to use. You absolutely must have a wiki topic or markdown file in your project that has links to how to apply every major pattern on your project. If you do this, it reduces wasted time in code reviews, and prevents people from introducing new patterns without a justifiable reason for having a discussion before it permeates throughout the codebase.
## Review new patterns early
Review new coding patterns with your team as soon as you introduce them. Rather than replace an existing pattern all over the code base (ask for forgiveness rather than permission), do your teammates a solid and be inclusive as soon as you have something to show. They'll probably have good advice for how to improve on your use of it, and you can get their buy-in and enlist them to help you with the full refactoring effort.
## Never expose refactoring
NEVER expose refactoring as tasks, user stories, or tickets in jira, github issues, trello, asana, visual studio online - or whatever tool your team may be using for work tracking. Whenever an essential engineering practice is called out as a separate item - it only tempts management to pull it out.
## Assume unexpected change
Always assume there will be unexpected change in the project for every task you need to estimate. Whether it's unplanned software design meetings, troubleshooting, or documentation - to write code like senior programmers actually do, you can't be pressured to cut corners. While we can't predict every possible uncertainty on a software project, if you estimate like nothing will go wrong - it's your own fault.
