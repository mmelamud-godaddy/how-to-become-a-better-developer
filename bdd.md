# Behavior Driven Development (BDD)
---
## TDD vs BDD. What's the difference?
- **TDD**

This means writing the tests before developing the software, making the software fit the tests (Red-Green Refactoring). Usually completed by writing unit tests before creating the software.

- **BDD**

This is not about testing. It is about conversations.

The development team will talk to the business about the requirements, gaining enough information to be able to write scenarios that make development of the software more aligned with the actual business needs. (Whether this is a Word document or a test, it doesn't matter).

The scenarios created should be understandable by the business, the development team and everyone in between using language that both agree on.
