# Avoid These Common Mistakes Developers Make!
---
 - ### Software Development is All About Coding!

Software Developers create software systems that are meant to solve problems for people in some way. Solving problems, not writing code that is our job. As a profession we are obsessed far too much about tools and don't spend enough time thinking about what we really are paid to do, so instead take more ownership of the problems that you're trying to solve. Always think: "Would I like to use this software?" and if the answer is "No" why is that? And could of you do something different to change that? You not going to be a great developer if you type lots of code faster. You'll become better developer if you solve more problems with less code.

 - ### If Only the Business Would Get the Requirements Right!
 
It's wrong to assume that developers job is to write code and someone elses job is to tell developers what code to write. Business cannot clearly and concisely tell you what the sollution to a problem is so you can translate that into code. If a developers job would be simply a translation job from a description that is detailed enough to be correct then could we just automate that translation and effectevly turn this description into the code itself? What then the point of developers at all? The people writing descriptions would be developers then. In reality it is much more difficult than that.
 
 - ### Speed is all That Matters!

Being a good typist and knowing you tools well enoght to move arround efficiently is certainly a good thing but if you are hoping that typing speed will improve your performance you are optimizing the wrong part of the problem. Developers aim should always be to write less code to resolve a problem. So pausing and thinking about the alternative ways forward is always a good idea.

 - ### My Job is to Code Not to Understand the Problem Domain!

However well you know your programming language and programming tools if you don't undestand the problem you are working on in some depth you'll do a poor job. You don't have to be a Domain Expert, it some ways it worse than that. The best programmers know the Problem Domain well enough to have Domain insights that even experts some times miss. We wont have same kind Domain expertise as a true Eomain Expert, and knowledge will often be a little bit more surfaced, but if we're doing well we'll spot a similarities and an opportunities that Domain Experts miss because they are too close to the problem. Pay attention when people are talking about Problem Domain. Work to establish a common language that you can share with Domain Experts to explore and explain problems.

 - ### I Can't Ask for Help! It Shows That I Don't Know Enough

It takes a certain amount of self confidence to ask questions. The truth is that more that you know the more you know that you don't know enough. Smart people ask questions. Dumb people think that they have all the answers. To be great as a software developer you must become comfortable with uncertainty. Ask questions. If a dumb person thinks you are dumb for asking questions that is their problem, not yours. The point of which this is not true is if you ask the same question over and over again. Allow yoursels a freedom to ask a question twice. if You want to ask a third time take the person with an answer to the side, fess up that you don't understand and ask them for some help. More times than not they will help You and thik better of You for doing this.

 - ### Software Architecture is for the Experts!
 
Designing good architecture takes experience. You need to have seen similar things done in at least three different ways and, idealy, in a three different technologies before You really have that kind of experience. Software Architecture is about more than just only creating it. A good Software Architecture is a bit like a tourist map of a system: it shows you enough to find your way around without going into too much detail so that you can't find out where you really are. Any developer should be able to describe how the system that they work on works, idealy, to a non-technical person, but at least to a technical person who does not know anything about the system. Could you explain architecture of a system to a non-technical person? What are the organizing principles in a system you are working on that really matter? What ideas helped You to decide where to place behaviour in your system? What the "tourist map" for your system? 
 
 - ### Testing is Someone Else's Job!

If you write code how do you know if it works? Even if you write code without an automated tests then presumably you'll run it first to see if it works. So debate comes to should our tests be automated or manual. Preferably tests should be automated. But who should write those tests? And the answer is us, developers. Developers are the people who write code that potentially can break tests and developers are the ones who will have to fix it. Developers should see the mistake first. we as developers should own the responsibility for the tests that are running and most of the time we are the best place to write them ourself too. Remember Agile exists to solve problems and not to write code. How can we tell that problem is solved without checking to see if it is?
