# Avoid These Common Mistakes Developers Make!
---
 - **Software Development is All About Coding!**

Software Developers create software systems that are meant to solve problems for people in some way. Solving problems, not writing code that is our job. As a profession we are obsessed far too much about tools and don't spend enough time thinking about what we really are paid to do, so instead take more ownership of the problems that you're trying to solve. Always think: "Would I like to use this software?" and if the answer is "No" why is that? And could of you do something different to change that? You not going to be a great developer if you type lots of code faster. You'll become better developer if you solve more problems with less code.

 - **If Only the Business Would Get the Requirements Right!**
 
It's wrong to assume that developers job is to write code and someone elses job to tell developers what code to write. Business cannot simply tell you what the sollution is so you can translate that into code.
 
 - **Speed is all That Matters!**

Being a good typist and knowing you tools well enoght to move arround efficiently is certainly a good thing but if you are hoping that typing speed will improve your performance you are optimizing the wrong part of the problem. Developers aim should always be to write less code to resolve a problem. So pausing and thinking about the alternative ways forward is always a good idea.

 - My Job is to Code Not to Understand the Problem Domain!
 - I Can't Ask for Help! It Shows That I Don't Know Enough
 - Software Architecture is for the Experts!
 - Testing is Someone Else's Job!
 - I Would Like to do a Better Job, But My Boss Won't Let Me!
