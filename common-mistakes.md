# Avoid These Common Mistakes Developers Make!
---
 - ### Software Development is All About Coding!

Software Developers create software systems that are meant to solve problems for people in some way. Solving problems, not writing code that is our job. As a profession we are obsessed far too much about tools and don't spend enough time thinking about what we really are paid to do, so instead take more ownership of the problems that you're trying to solve. Always think: "Would I like to use this software?" and if the answer is "No" why is that? And could of you do something different to change that? You not going to be a great developer if you type lots of code faster. You'll become better developer if you solve more problems with less code.

 - ### If Only the Business Would Get the Requirements Right!
 
It's wrong to assume that developers job is to write code and someone elses job is to tell developers what code to write. Business cannot clearly and concisely tell you what the sollution to a problem is so you can translate that into code. If a developers job would be simply a translation job from a description that is detailed enough to be correct then could we just automate that translation and effectevly turn this description into the code itself? What then the point of developers at all? The people writing descriptions would be developers then. In reality it is much more difficult than that.
 
 - ### Speed is all That Matters!

Being a good typist and knowing you tools well enoght to move arround efficiently is certainly a good thing but if you are hoping that typing speed will improve your performance you are optimizing the wrong part of the problem. Developers aim should always be to write less code to resolve a problem. So pausing and thinking about the alternative ways forward is always a good idea.

 - ### My Job is to Code Not to Understand the Problem Domain!

However well you know your programming language and programming tools if you don't undestand the problem you are working on in some depth you'll do a poor job. You don't have to be a Domain Expert, it some ways it worse than that. The best programmers know the Problem Domain well enough to have Domain insights that even experts some times miss. We wont have same kind Domain expertise as a true Eomain Expert, and knowledge will often be a little bit more surfaced, but if we're doing well we'll spot a similarities and an opportunities that Domain Experts miss because they are too close to the problem. Pay attention when people are talking about Problem Domain. Work to establish a common language that you can share with Domain Experts to explore and explain problems.

 - ### I Can't Ask for Help! It Shows That I Don't Know Enough

It takes a certain amount of self confidence to ask questions. The truth is that more that you know the more you know that you don't know enough. Smart people ask questions. Dumb people think that they have all the answers. To be great as a software developer you must become comfortable with uncertainty. Ask questions. If a dumb person thinks you are dumb for asking questions that is their problem, not yours. The point of which this is not true is if you ask the same question over and over again. Allow yoursels a freedom to ask a question twice. if You want to ask a third time take the person with an answer to the side, fess up that you don't understand and ask them for some help. More times than not they will help You and thik better of You for doing this.

 - ### Software Architecture is for the Experts!
 
Designing good architecture takes experience. You need to have seen similar things done in at least three different ways and, idealy, in a three different technologies before You really have that kind of experience. Software Architecture is about more than just only creating it. A good Software Architecture is a bit like a tourist map of a system: it shows you enough to find your way around without going into too much detail so that you can't find out where you really are. Any developer should be able to describe how the system that they work on works, idealy, to a non-technical person, but at least to a technical person who does not know anything about the system. Could you explain architecture of a system to a non-technical person? What are the organizing principles in a system you are working on that really matter? What ideas helped You to decide where to place behaviour in your system? What the "tourist map" for your system? 
 
 - ### Testing is Someone Else's Job!

Testing is an integral part of software development, and the responsibility for ensuring that the software works correctly lies with the developer.

If a developer writes code without testing it, they are not aware of any potential bugs or issues that might arise. This can lead to faulty software, which can cause problems for users and damage the reputation of the developer and the company they work for.

Automated tests are preferable to manual tests because they are faster, more accurate, and can be run automatically as part of the build process. This reduces the risk of human error and ensures that the software is tested thoroughly and consistently.

Developers are the best people to write automated tests because they understand the code they have written, and they are familiar with the requirements and functionality of the software. They are also responsible for fixing any issues that are found, so they are motivated to ensure that the software is tested thoroughly.

In summary, it is a mistake for developers to think that testing and writing tests is not their responsibility. Testing is an essential part of software development, and the responsibility for ensuring that the software works correctly lies with the developer. Developers should take ownership of the testing process, write automated tests, and ensure that the software is thoroughly tested before it is released.

 - ### I Would Like to do a Better Job, But My Boss Won't Let Me!
 - ### If Only Customers Would Use Our Product in the Way We Designed and Developed It!

Developers often assume that their customers will use their products exactly as they were designed and developed. However, this belief can lead to misguided assumptions, as customers have different needs, preferences, and contexts that can affect how they interact with the product.

To create a valuable and satisfying product, developers must embrace customer feedback and be willing to make changes to the product based on this feedback. By doing so, developers can create a product that meets the unique needs and expectations of their customers, resulting in increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.
